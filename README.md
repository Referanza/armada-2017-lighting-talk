# For fun and Pseudo-profit
A short live coding session where get to see just how much can be done using
pure CSS in modern web browsers.

Presented at Armada THS 2017

# Get started
You need [`node`](https://nodejs.org/) and
[`git`](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/). Then run these commands
in a terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Referanza/armada-2017-lighting-talk.git
cd armada-2017-lighting-talk
npm install # or just `yarn` if you prefer

node server.js # Start the local server
```

Then head over to http://localhost:3000/ and voila, you can see a beautiful web
page. Edit any file under `app` and watch the browser automatically reload.
